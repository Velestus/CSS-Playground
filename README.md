# CSS Playground

This project contains all my React components on which I was training my **_CSS3_** skills.

Each folder contains separate, ready to import React component.
I have also added those designs into **CodePen** to allow quick peek.
All components will be available to see on [this website].

**What can be more interesting than some screenshots? Take a look!**

- _[Simple Axe]_ - 2D drawing of axe. Weapon consists of two div elements wrapped in parent div to allow animation of whole weapon.
- _[Rubik's Cube]_ - 3D drawing of Rubik's Cube. Added rotating animation to show every side of the cube.
